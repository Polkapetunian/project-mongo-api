## The problem

I wanted to use some data of interest to me. As I have studied landscape architecture I am familiar with trees. I found open data from municipality of Ume√• with trees that are taken care of by the Park department. The original json that I could download from their open data site was a bit complicated with lots of nested objects and arrays. So I downloaded an excel file instead and changed it up a bit. Then I saved it as a CSV file and used a web app, csvjson.com to convert it to json. 

I would have liked to use the geopoints but was unsure about how to go about. I started by just adding them as strings to the database.
